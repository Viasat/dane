DANE is a hackable dataset generation tool to collect network traffic in a variety of configurable network conditions.

Our tool establishes Docker containers with configurable network conditions,
then runs target (and customizable!) behaviors such as browsing the internet, and collects data on
the network traffic generated using
[network-stats](https://github.com/Viasat/network-stats). It supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.
